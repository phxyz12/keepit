# Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy provides our policies and procedures for collecting, using, and disclosing your information. Users access the KeepIT Service (“Service”) through the KeepIT application and the KeepIT website (this website). A “Device” is any computer used to access the KeepIT Service, including without limitation a desktop, laptop, mobile phone, tablet, or other consumer electronic device. This Privacy Policy governs your access of the KeepIT Service, regardless of how you access it, and by using our Service you consent to the collection, transfer, processing, storage, disclosure and other uses described in this Privacy Policy. All of the different forms of data, content, and information described below are collectively referred to as “information.”

## 1. The Information We Collect And Store
We do not actively collect any personal information from you when running the KeepIT Service.

Information You Provide in the KeepIT Service application:
The only way personal information is entered and stored in the KeepIT Service is when you are typing this information into notes created and stored in the KeepIT Service application at you own wish and decision. In addition, you may provide a password to secure access to your notes in the KeepIT Service application. This password is not stored in original form by the KeepIT Service. Only a hash value of this password is stored in the KeepIT Service appliaction's Android App settings located in the Android App's private storage space on your device's internal storage. This is a standard Andriod feature.

Information You Provide on the KeepIT Service website:
The only information you can enter on the  KeepIT Service website is what you type into the contact form which sends us a message containing your entered data by email. This information is transferred by standard email in an unencrypted form via the email services of the hosting provider. Your data is not stored on the  KeepIT Service website. Your email received by us is stored on our local computer systems. We do not disclose the information you provide in your email and we do not provide this information to other parties.

## 2. How We Use Personal Information
The only personal information we might get from you is when you contact us by email, regular mail or a phone call. We do not disclose any information you provide and we do not provide this information to other parties. We only use your information in the conversation with you to assist you.


## 3. Information Sharing and Disclosure

## 4. Changing or Deleting Your Information
If you provided personal information to us within correspondence in any form, you can request us to delete the information, e.g. emails, at any time. We will delete any such data at your request permanently.


## 5. Data Retention
We will retain your information for three years after you provided it. After three years, we delete this information, e.g. emails, permanently.


## 6. Security
The security of your information is important to us. The KeepIT Service application only stores data you enter in the application's private storage space on the internal storage of your device.  The KeepIT Service application does not transfer your data to targets outside the application as long as you do not actively use the built-in «share» functionality. The latter functionality does allow you to send data to other apps on your device.  The KeepIT Service application does not have any networking permissions and does not create any connections to other systems.


## 7. Our Policy Toward Children
Our Service is not directed to persons under 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal Information without their consent, he or she should contact us. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with Personal Information, we will take steps to delete such information from our files.


## 8. Changes to our Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy may change from time to time. If we make a change to this privacy policy that we believe materially reduces your rights, we will provide you with notice (for example, by email). And we may provide notice of changes in other circumstances as well. By continuing to use the Service after those changes become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy.


## 9. The KeepIT website (this website)

Based on Article 13 of the Swiss Federal Constitution ("schweizerische Bundesverfassung") and the data protection provisions of the Federal ("Datenschutzgesetz, DSG") everyone has the right on privacy and protection from misuse of their personal data. We comply with these provisions. Personal data will be treated in strict confidence and neither sold nor given to third parties.
